							Connecting Organizations and Users
						</span>
						<p>
							Rare FND connects non-profits, universities, start-ups and other
							companies looking to fundraise (“Organizations”) with those
							looking to donate or contribute tokens and other assets to such
							Organizations (“Donors”, “Contributors”). When we use the word
							“you” in these Terms, it refers to any user, regardless of whether
							he or she is a Donor or Contributor or is using the Services on
							behalf of an Organization or a Donor or Contributor, while if we
							use one of those specific terms, it only applies to that category
							of user.
						</p>
						<p>
							Rare FND takes steps to confirm each potential Organization is a
							registered nonprofit organization or incorporated company by
							confirming the tax ID number. In the US and UAE, nonprofit
							organizations are tax-exempt. For international organizations, we
							confirm they are the equivalent is a registered organization and
							confirm they are registered in their respective countries.
							However, each Donor or Contributor must make its own
							determinations that an Organization available through our Service
							is suitable for such Donor or Contributor. Rare FND is only
							responsible for connecting Organizations and Donors or
							Contributors, and is not and will not be responsible for the use
							of any Donations or Contributions. Rare FND similarly is not and
							will not be responsible for ensuring that information (including
							credentials) an Organization or Donor or Contributor provides is
							accurate or up-to-date. We don’t control the actions of any
							Organization or Donor or Contributor.
						</p>
						<p>
							Rare FND does not offer or accept the Donations or Contributions.
							You hereby acknowledge that (i) Rare FND does not supervise,
							direct, control or monitor the Donations or Contributions and (ii)
							Rare FND expressly disclaims any responsibility and liability for
							any Organization or any Donation or Contribution made through the
							Service, including but not limited to any warranty or condition of
							quality or fitness for a particular purpose, or compliance with
							any law, regulation, or code. Organizations and Donors or
							Contributors must not enter into separate agreements outside of
							Rare FND relating to Donations or Contributions (“Outside
							Agreements”). If you do enter into any Outside Agreement we may
							terminate your Rare FND account, and you acknowledge that Rare FND
							is not a party to and isn’t responsible for enforcing any Outside
							Agreement.

							How Campaigns Work?
						</span>
						<p>
							When an Organization posts a campaign on Rare FND, they’re
							inviting other people to form a contract with them. Anyone who
							donates or contributes to a campaign is accepting the
							Organization’s offer, and forming that contract.
						</p>
						<p>
							Rare FND is not a part of this contract—the contract is a direct
							legal agreement between Organizations and their Contributors or
							Donators. Here are the terms that govern that agreement:
						</p>
						<p>
							When a campaign is successfully funded, the Organization must
							complete the campaign and fulfill each reward. Once a Organization
							has done so, they’ve satisfied their obligation to their Donators
							or Contributors.
						</p>
						<p>
							Each reward is distributed via NFT before an Organization
							completes their campaign.{" "}
						</p>
						<p>
							Throughout the process, Organizations owe their Donators or
							Contributors a high standard of effort, honest communication, and
							a dedication to bringing the campaign to life. At the same time,
							Donators or Contributors must understand that they’re not buying
							something when they back a campaign—they’re helping to create
							something new, not ordering something that already exists. There
							may be changes or delays, and there’s a chance something could
							happen that prevents the Organization from being able to finish
							the campaign as promised.
						</p>
						<p>
							If an Organization is unable to complete their campaign and
							fulfill rewards, they’ve failed to live up to the basic
							obligations of this agreement. To right this, they must make every
							reasonable effort to find another way of bringing the campaign to
							the best possible conclusion for Donators or Contributors. An
							Organization in this position has only remedied the situation and
							met their obligations to Donators or Contributors if:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								they post an update that explains what work has been done, how
								funds were used, and what prevents them from finishing the
								campaign as planned;
							</li>
							<li>
								they work diligently and in good faith to bring the campaign to
								the best possible conclusion in a timeframe that’s communicated
								to Donators or Contributors;
							</li>
							<li>
								they’re able to demonstrate that they’ve used funds
								appropriately and made every reasonable effort to complete the
								campaign as promised;
							</li>
							<li>
								they’ve been honest, and have made no material
								misrepresentations in their communication to Donators or
								Contributors; and
							</li>
							<li>
								they offer to return any remaining funds to Donators or
								Contributors who have not received their reward (in proportion
								to the amounts pledged), or else explain how those funds will be
								used to complete the campaign in some alternate form.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The Organization is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises
							made in their campaign. If they’re unable to satisfy the terms of
							this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by Donators or
							Contributors.
						</p>

							How Campaigns Are Funded?
						</span>
						<br />
						The below points outline how you as a contributor or donator fund a
						campaign:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							You’re charged upon donating or contributing to a campaign. When
							you donate or contribute you are charged up front and the payment
							is taken either in fiat, or in tokens. The exact amount you donate
							in your local currency is converted to FND token at a conversion
							rate at the time the payment is made.
						</li>
						<li>
							Your payment is automatically staked at a rate of 240% APY. Rare
							FND and its payment partners will take the payment and it will be
							held in a staking smart contract. This staking smart contract
							generates a yield to help assist the organization with reaching
							their goals.
						</li>
						<li>
							The estimated delivery is the organization’s estimate. The month
							and year listed on each reward is the Organization’s estimate of
							when they will provide the reward—not a guarantee to fulfill by
							that time. The schedule may change as the Organization works on
							the campaign. We ask Organizations to think carefully, set an
							estimated delivery they feel confident they can work toward, and
							communicate with backers about any changes.
						</li>
						<li>
							The Organization may need to send you questions about your reward.
							To deliver rewards, the Organization might need information from
							you, like your mailing address or t-shirt size. They’ll request
							that information after the campaign has succeeded. To receive the
							reward, you’ll need to provide the information in a reasonable
							amount of time. Organizations should not ask for personal
							information that is not necessary to provide your reward, and
							should never request sensitive personal information such as your
							Social Security number or payment information.{" "}
						</li>
						<li>
							Rare FND doesn’t offer refunds if an Organization successfully
							completes its campaign. Responsibility for finishing a campaign
							lies entirely with the campaign Organization, however Rare FND
							safeguards donators and contributors throughout the delivery of
							the campaign through a vesting schedule. Rare FND, however,
							doesn’t hold funds on Organizations’ behalf, cannot guarantee
							Organizations’ work, and does not offer refunds directly.
						</li>
						<li>
							You will be refunded if the Organization fails to complete its
							campaign. If for any reason the Organization fails to meet his
							crowdfunding campaign target then all donations and contributions
							will be refunded the amount of FND tokens donated or contributed
							at the time the donation of contribution was made. Due to the
							automated staking, refunds will also include rewards of a 240%
							increase for the duration between the time of donation or
							contribution, and the time the Organization failed to complete its
							campaign.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These are the terms that apply when you’re creating a campaign:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							We do not charge ANY fees at any point of the campaign. Rare FND
							and its payment partners will pay the full amount raised on the
							platform with no fees subtracted at any point.
						</li>
						<li>
							Prepare for potential delays. Don’t assume you’ll be able to
							launch your campaign when you want; there could be a reason we’re
							not able to accept it, or a problem that takes time to resolve.
							Don’t assume you’ll be able to immediately collect your funding;
							there may be a delay between the end of a successful campaign and
							your access to the funds. And don’t take any actions in reliance
							on collecting any of the money pledged until you actually have the
							ability to withdraw it from your account and spend it.
						</li>
						<li>
							You will not receive the full amount raised at once. Due to the
							way Rare FND is run which enables Organizations to raise funds for
							free without paying any fees or commission, but also to enable
							Organizations to raise funds quicker through automated staking on
							all donations and contributions at a rate of 240% APY, it means
							that funds raised will not be paid in one single transaction. As
							per you project plan submitted during the sign-up phase, funds
							will be paid out as and when required as stated in your schedule
							of spend. Before each round of funds is released on the scheduled
							date then evidence must be provided to prove that the previous
							release of funds has been used for it’s intended use as per the
							project plan. Any change to the project plan must be updated
							before funds are released for the new changes made.{" "}
						</li>
						<li>
							You will be paid in FND token. At the time of funds being
							released, then you are sent the equivalent amount raised in your
							local currency, in FND, with the conversion rate being taken from
							the time of funds being released. Once you have received your FND
							funds as per your vesting schedule it is your responsibility to
							sell to realise your local currency value. If you choose not to
							sell at the time of funds being released and the price of the FND
							token decreases, then Rare FND will not reimburse you the
							differences. Equally, if you choose not to sell at the time of
							funds being releases and the price of the FND token increases,
							Rare FND will not seek to reclaim any additional funds realised in
							your local currency.{" "}

							Do the Services cost anything?
						</span>
						<br /> The Services on Rare FND are completely free. Rare FND does
						not charge the organization any fees neither does it take any
						commission from any funds raised. Through our automated staking
						mechanism, Rare FND pays organizations to use our platform!
