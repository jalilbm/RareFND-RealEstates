							$FND tokens:
						</span>{" "}
						The native cryptographically-secure fungible protocol token of the
						Rare Fnd platform (ticker symbol{" "}
						<span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>$FND</span>) is a transferable
						representation of attributed utility functions specified in the
						protocol/code of the Rare Fnd platform, and which is designed to be
						used solely as an interoperable utility token thereon.
					</p>
					<p>
						$FND is a functional multi-utility token which will be used as the
						medium of exchange between participants on the Rare Fnd platform in
						a decentralised manner. The goal of introducing $FND is to provide a
						convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between
						participants who interact within the ecosystem on the Rare Fnd
						platform without any intermediaries such as centralised third party
						entity/institution/credit. It is not, and not intended to be, a
						medium of exchange accepted by the public (or a section of the
						public) as payment for goods or services or for the discharge of a
						debt; nor is it designed or intended to be used by any person as
						payment for any goods or services whatsoever that are not
						exclusively provided by the issuer. $FND does not in any way
						represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest
						in the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates, or any
						other company, enterprise or undertaking, nor will $FND entitle
						token holders to any promise of fees, dividends, revenue, profits or
						investment returns, and are not intended to constitute securities in
						Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction. $FND may only be utilised on
						the Rare Fnd platform, and ownership of the same carries no rights,
						express or implied, other than the right to use $FND as a means to
						enable usage of and interaction within the Rare Fnd platform. The
						secondary market pricing of $FND is not dependent on the effort of
						the Rare Fnd team, and there is no token functionality or scheme
						designed to control or manipulate such secondary pricing.
					</p>
					<p>
						Further, $FND provides the economic incentives which will be
						distributed to encourage users to exert efforts towards contribution
						and participation in the ecosystem on the Rare Fnd platform, thereby
						creating a mutually beneficial system where every participant is
						fairly compensated for its efforts. $FND are an integral and
						indispensable part of the Rare Fnd platform, because without $FND,
						there would be no incentive for users to expend resources to
						participate in activities or provide services for the benefit of the
						entire ecosystem on the Rare Fnd platform. Given that additional
						$FND will be awarded to a user based only on its actual usage,
						activity and efforts made on the Rare Fnd platform and/or
						proportionate to the frequency and volume of transactions, users of
						the Rare Fnd platform and/or holders of $FND which did not actively
						participate will not receive any $FND incentives.
					</p>
					<p>
						$FND has the following specific features:
						<ol className="alpha">
							<li>
								<span style={{ fontWeight: "normal" }}>
									As the native platform currency, all contributions to projects
									or charities can only be made in the native token of FND.
								</span>
							</li>
							<li>
								<span style={{ fontWeight: "normal" }}>
									Once contributed, the FND is automatically staked as a

									project to hit their target quicker (or if the project fails,
									contributions are refunded).

							</li>

								<span style={{ fontWeight: "normal" }}>
