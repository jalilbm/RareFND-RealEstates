							Personal Data We Collect
						</span>
						<br />
						In order for you to create an account on Rare FND and use our
						Services, we need to collect and process certain information.
						Depending on your use of the Services, that may include:
						<br />
						<ul>
							<li>
								Information you provide by completing forms on Rare FND — your
								name, email and postal addresses, telephone number, country of
								residence, login, and password details. We may ask for this
								information if you register as a user of the Services, subscribe
								to our newsletters, upload or submit content through Rare FND,
								or if you contact us;
							</li>
							<li>
								Information you provide for identity verification purposes when
								launching a project, including your legal name, business name,
								company registration and Tax ID for business entities, and date
								of birth. In some cases, our payment processor will request that
								you provide a secure upload of an identity document (such as
								your passport, drivers license or other government-issued ID) to
								Rare FND;
							</li>
							<li>
								Details of any requests or transactions you make through the
								Services. Rare FND partners with other companies (such as
								Moonpay) for payment processing, and the payment information you
								submit is collected and used by them in accordance with their
								privacy policies (read Moonpay's privacy policy). Rare FND
								doesn’t store your payment information apart from the last four
								digits of your credit card or bank account (as applicable),
								expiration date, and country, which we require for tax,
								government regulatory, and security purposes;
							</li>
							<li>
								Information about your activity on and interaction with Rare
								FND, including use of our mobile apps (such as your IP address,
								the type of device or browser you use, and your actions on the
								Site);
							</li>
							<li>
								Information about the ways people visit and interact with our
								Site, in the form of traffic analytics.
							</li>
							<li>
								Information necessary for using Google Maps features and

								Communications you send to us (for example, when you ask for
								support, send us questions or comments, or report a problem);
							</li>
							<li>
								Information that you submit on or to Rare FND in the form of
								comments, contributions to discussions, or messages to other
								users; and
							</li>
							<li>
								The email address associated with your Facebook account, if you
								choose to sign up using your Facebook credentials. Rare FND will
								also request permission to access your name, profile picture,
								and friend list (these permissions are governed by Facebook’s
								privacy policies and can be managed through your Facebook
								privacy settings). We never post anything to your Facebook,
								Twitter, or other third-party accounts without your permission.
							</li>
							<li>
								Demographic information—such as your age, gender identity,
								sexual orientation, race, and ethnicity—that you have the option
								to provide to us after giving your consent to the processing of
								those personal data in order to help Rare FND equitably support
								all creators and represent a diverse population in our research.

								Your wallet address should you choose to make a payment using
								FND tokens.{" "}
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							You may decline to provide us with your information. However, this
							will limit your ability to register for an account or use our
							Services. You may donate or contribute to a project as a guest by
							providing only your wallet address. However, to adjust your
							amount, save payment details for future payments, make project
							comments and take most other actions on our Site, you will need to
							create an account. You may review, change or remove your
							information through your account settings.
